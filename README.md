## Features

  * Robust routing
  * Focus on high performance
  * Super-high test coverage
  * HTTP helpers (redirection, caching, etc)
  * View system supporting 14+ template engines
  * Content negotiation
  * Executable for generating applications quickly


## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https://github.com/ladjs/consolidate),
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

```

  Then install the dependencies:

```bash
